      I have always been curious in change -- I find that 
      the way we choose to percieve it, respond to it, & feel about it can be a tremendous
      catalyst for creativity.

      I was born in Lausanne, Switzerland and by the time I started middle school I had
      already moved 7 times. This brewed a penchant for exploration
      and a big appetite for new experiences in my young brain.

      I approach both my life and work with the same curiosity and hunger.
