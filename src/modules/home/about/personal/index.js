        I have always been curious in change -- I find that 
        the way we choose to percieve it, respond to it, and feel about it can be a tremendous
        catalyst for creativity.

        I was born in Lausanne, Switzerland and by the time I started middle school I had
        already moved 7 times. This brewed a penchant for exploration
        and a big appetite for new experiences in my young brain.

        I approach both my life and work with the same curiosity and hunger.
