      I believe robust UI-UX design takes both empathy and strategy. I apply myself toward 
      designing simple interfaces and distinct user experiences. My mission for each project
      is to build work that is not only clear and directive, but intuitive and memorable.
      I am currently looking to join a team where quality work comes
      from the cross-pollination of each other's enthusiasm.
