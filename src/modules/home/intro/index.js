      I love the thought that creativity can solve any problem, and so,
      the creative process is always on my mind.  Making products as attractive
      & well formed as they are effective is where I apply myself.
      I am currently looking to join a team where quality work comes
      from the cross-pollination of each other's enthusiasm.
